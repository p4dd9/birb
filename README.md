You can find all leaderboards and stats in the main menu in the game. There are _currently_ two types of leaderboards: Scores and Games played. Each type is scoped to the community the game has been installed.

If a player scores a new highscore within the community leaderboard, it is sticky commented on the posting itself.  
_Currently there is no global leaderboard or cross-play for communities (yet)._

Most importantly, players' scores and games played are accumulated to a community score! This score is planned to be featured with new perks, ranks and stats in the future on a community scope to allow cross-community gameplay and leaderboards.

## 🏅 Ranks

There are currently 9+ ranks to be claimed as an individual player that is based on your games played. Each Redditors sees their current rank and how many games are left for the next rank in the main menu.

## 🧝 Dailys

Dailys are currently in active development.
Each Daily is available for 24hrs and resets if not completed. They can be achieved one time. Currently, the daily quests are limited to a +50 bonus for beating your own highscore, that will be added to the community score.

## 💪 Difficulty

The game gets harder, the longer you play in one run. This can include:

- Rainy Weather
- Moving Pipes
- Smaller Gaps
- Flickering Pipes
- Invisible Pipes

## 🎨 Customization

Moderators can change the city background, birds and pipes to match their community's style.

- 4+ city backgrounds
- 6+ brid characters
- 7+ pipe visuals
